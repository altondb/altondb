- 👋 Hi, I’m @altondb
- 👀 I’m really into machine learning and data visualization. I love finding hidden patterns in data and building models that solve real-world problems. Visualizing data in a way that makes it easy to understand and impactful is something I’m passionate about.
- 🌱 Right now, I’m diving deeper into artificial intelligence. I’m exploring cool stuff like deep learning, neural networks, and natural language processing. I’m also learning more about data science tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Apache Spark to handle big data and create awesome models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on industry projects where I can put my data science skills to use. I want to work with teams to create data-driven solutions that make a real difference. Whether it’s consulting, project-based work, or open-source contributions, I’m open to it all!
